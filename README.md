Client Dataset Analysis

    Overview:
        This Python script performs an analysis of a client dataset using Pandas Library. The dataset includes information about clients, orders, items, and costs. The analysis covers data cleaning, column renaming, and the creation of additional columns for insights into spending, shipping costs, and profits.

    Summary:
        In this analysis of the client dataset, I transformed the data by renaming columns for clarity and calculating additional metrics like line subtotals, shipping prices, and total profits. I confirmed the accuracy of my calculations against provided receipts. I identified key insights, including the top 5 clients' total spending, shipping costs, revenues, and profits, and presented the results in a clear manner.

Key Operations

    Data Cleaning and Exploration:
        Imported and displayed the dataset.
        Renamed columns for clarity.
        Explored summary statistics and top entries.

    Category and Sub-Category Analysis:
        Identified the most common category.
        Determined the sub-category with the highest entries in the identified category.

    Top Clients Analysis:
        Identified the top 5 clients by the number of entries.
        Calculated total spending for each of the top clients.

    Line Item Calculations:
        Created columns for; line subtotal, total weight, shipping price, total price, total cost, and gross profit.

    Validation and Checks:
        Checked calculations using specific order IDs.
        Verified spending for the top 5 clients.

    Summary Statistics for Top Clients
        Created a summary DataFrame for the top 5 clients, including total quantity purchased, shipping price, total revenue and total profit.
        Formatted data for presentation in millions $USD.

    Sorting and Presentation
        Sorted the summary data by total profit in descending order.
        Displayed the final summary DataFrame.
